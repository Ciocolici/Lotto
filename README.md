# Lotto

A simple C# (CSharp) Console App exercise project, done during my classes for IT Specialist in Application Development by Lutz + Grub Academy.  
It simulates a basic lottery game using random numbers and compares them to the user's input.

The code was written independently by me. The class only provided a general idea of what the project should do.

*To run the Console App program directly, launch "Lotto.exe" located in "bin/Debug/net7.0/".*

*Note: German language used.*
